Taking screenshots of the user’s desktop can be useful just to see what they are doing. It can show what systems or applications they're using, what shortcuts they have, what documents they’re working on and so on.

Beacon has multiple commands for taking screenshots which work in slightly different ways.

```shell
printscreen               Take a single screenshot via PrintScr method
screenshot                Take a single screenshot
screenwatch               Take periodic screenshots of desktop
```
```shell
beacon> screenshot
[*] received screenshot of Secret Application - Internet Explorer from bfarmer (61kb)
```

To see all the screenshots that have been taken, go to **View > Screenshots**.
